    <h3> FAQs</h3>
    <br>
    <b id="faq_4x400_registration">Q: How do I register for the 4x400 relay?</b>
    <br/>
    <i>4x400 relay registration is available online only if you are connected with a "team" in your athletic.net profile. If you want to register online for the 4x400 relay, make sure your profile is connected to a team (if desired, you can connect with the <a href="https://www.athletic.net/team/85399/track-and-field-outdoor/2024">Pittsburgh Pharaoh Hounds</a> team). But don't worry: if you are unable to register for the 4x400 relay online, you can just register a team at the registration tent during the meet as the 4x400 approaches; listen for announcements at the meet for details.</i>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Q: Is there a rain date in case of bad weather? ðŸŒ§</b>
    <br/>
    <i>A: No, there is no rain date for the Petite Track Meet. We plan to finish all events by 10 PM when our permit for the track expires. However, in the event of weather deemed unsafe, we may delay or pause events and will run as many remaining events as possible before 10 PM. Listen for announcements at the meet.</i>
